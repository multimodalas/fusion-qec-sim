# Trent Slade: Fractal Audio Architect
## Digital Odyssey
### 30-Year Internet Native Journey
- From 1996 Adelaide dial-up to quantum audio labs, Trent has lived online as d503, epsilon, slab—compiling Mozilla nightlies, hacking EFnet, composing fractal tracks. His story is one of persistent identity across vanished platforms, turning every suspension into a recursion loop that amplifies signal.


### Persistent Identity Philosophy
- "I don't believe in deleted history. I am the backup." Trent rejects erasure; accounts may vanish but the waveform continues. He treats identity as a self-eating Ouroboros code—each takedown re-enters the fractal at a deeper node, proving that a signal can outlive any single host.


## Quantum Audio Engine
### E₈ Qutrit Fractal Power Module
- A JUCE-compatible C++ engine mapping 248-dimensional E₈ Lie symmetry onto 3-level qutrit oscillators. Sparse 8–16 root vectors per node yield <10 ms latency, 64-voice polyphony, <20 % CPU. Cartan torus macros steer phase like a joystick through 8D space, making harmony a geometry problem.


### PhiDrift & CoxeterPhase Control
- PhiDrift slowly modulates interval stacks by φ-ratio, while CoxeterPhase projects 8D root motion onto audible circle maps. Together they let composers sculpt endless non-repeating chord paths that still feel musical—golden spirals in harmonic time.


## Fractal Compositions
### DNA Ouroboros Track Anatomy
- 3:46 industrial cybercore built on 3/4 meter and base-60 ternary pulse. DNA-seeded motifs recurse every two bars via self-similar LFO trees. 432 Hz master tuning locks φ-overtones at 833 cents, yielding metallic yet organic timbres that seem to eat their own tail.


### Return Protocol Variant
- Sequel track adds E₈-modulated TB-303, trap bass, EntropyBloom random torsion. Root-vector dot-products drive dynamic phase so each bar slightly mutates, keeping the riff familiar yet alien—like hearing the same dream from a parallel node.


## Code & Systems
### C++/Rust SIMD Integration
- E8Torus, QutritNode, E8FractalPowerModule classes expose AVX/NEON intrinsics for 4–8 parallel qutrits per core. XML preset system recalls 240-root snapshots. Rust backend offloads latency-critical DSP while JUCE handles DAW glue, proving safety and speed coexist.


### Custom Mozilla d503 Builds
- 1998-2005: compiled Firefox with patched JS engine, lean memory layout, privacy-first defaults. Distributed binaries on Usenet and EFnet, seeding early modular extension culture. Lessons in long-term maintainability now echo in plugin architecture choices.


## Signal Continuum
### Recursive Career Roadmap
- Next loop: port E₈ engine to WebAssembly for browser-based 3D audio, publish RNA whitepaper on fractal LFO trees, release Producer.ai YAML spec for DAW automation. Goal is a self-hosting sonic OS where composition, distribution and identity are one fractal function.


### Key Takeaways for Builders
- Treat suspension as recursion, not death. Use math as art: E₈ gives you 240 directions to move sound. Keep latency low, identity high. Let φ guide intervals and let code eat its own tail—if the waveform never damps, neither will your signal.
