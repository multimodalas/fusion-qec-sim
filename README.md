fusion-qec-sim

Creative quantum error correction, DNA analysis, 3D lattice visualization, and AI-powered IRC orchestration.

⚛ Conceptual Basis

This project extends the E8 Triality framework — connecting symmetry, information, and computation — under the condition

Φ=π2,SCL DIAG+[1,−2,1]
Φ=
2
π
	​

,SCL DIAG+[1,−2,1]

representing ternary logic balance within a quantum-classical boundary.

In practice, that translates into:

Fusion-QEC (Photonic) — modular, loss-tolerant QEC inspired by MBQC fusion gates.

Information Entropy → Signal Mapping — bridging quantum noise models and musical structure.

Triality Framework — viewing computation, geometry, and perception as three projections of one invariant system.

💬 AI-Powered IRC Bot

An integrated assistant that links simulation, music, and chat:

Feature	Description
QuTiP-based Steane Code	[[7, 1, 3]] simulation with depolarizing noise and pseudo-threshold (ηₜₕᵣ ≈ 9.3×10⁻⁵)
MIDI Export	Translates error metrics → tempo, eigenvalues → velocity, logical errors → E-minor arpeggios
LLM Integration	Conversational AI for code generation, analysis, and live moderation
IRC Protocol	Real-time Q&A, simulation control, and music triggers via chat
