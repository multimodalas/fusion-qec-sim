Quantum Error Correction ‚Äî fusion-qec-sim

Creative quantum error correction, DNA analysis, 3D lattice visualization, and AI-powered IRC orchestration.

‚öõ Conceptual Basis

This project builds on the E8 Triality framework ‚Äî uniting symmetry, information, and computation ‚Äî under the guiding relation:

<pre> Œ¶ = œÄ / 2‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉSCL DIAG + [1, ‚àí2, 1] </pre>

This defines a ternary balance across the quantum‚Äìclassical boundary, where each component of the [1, ‚àí2, 1] vector encodes a reversible polarity between signal, coherence, and loss.

In practical terms:

Fusion-QEC (Photonic) ‚Äî modular, loss-tolerant error correction inspired by MBQC fusion gates.

Information Entropy ‚Üí Signal Mapping ‚Äî translating quantum noise dynamics into musical structure.

Triality Framework ‚Äî treating computation, geometry, and perception as three projections of a single invariant form.
