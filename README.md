Quantum Error Correction — fusion-qec-sim

Creative quantum error correction, DNA analysis, 3D lattice visualization, and AI-powered IRC orchestration.

⚛ Conceptual Basis

This project builds on the E8 Triality framework — uniting symmetry, information, and computation — under the guiding relation:

<pre> Φ = π / 2  SCL DIAG + [1, −2, 1] </pre>

This defines a ternary balance across the quantum–classical boundary, where each component of the [1, −2, 1] vector encodes a reversible polarity between signal, coherence, and loss.

In practical terms:

Fusion-QEC (Photonic) — modular, loss-tolerant error correction inspired by MBQC fusion gates.

Information Entropy → Signal Mapping — translating quantum noise dynamics into musical structure.

Triality Framework — treating computation, geometry, and perception as three projections of a single invariant form.

### 🎧 E8 Triality Sonification Demo

Experience the sound of **symmetry meeting error correction** —  
data from `qec_data_prepared.csv` transformed into harmonic structure  
using the relation <code>Φ = π / 2 SCL DIAG + [ 1 , − 2 , 1 ]</code>.

> Each amplitude and interval reflects the quantum balance of signal, coherence, and loss.  
> This render was generated directly from the QEC simulation pipeline.
