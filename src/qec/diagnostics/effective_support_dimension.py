"""
v8.1.0 — Effective Support Dimension Diagnostic.

Computes the effective support dimension of the dominant NB eigenvector,
defined as the exponential of the spectral entropy:

    D_eff = exp(entropy)

This gives an effective count of edges that carry significant energy.
When the eigenvector is uniformly spread, D_eff equals the number of
directed edges.  When localized, D_eff approaches 1.

Layer 3 — Diagnostics.
Does not import or modify the decoder (Layer 1).
Fully deterministic: no randomness, no global state, no input mutation.
